Data.js
=======

A library-independent library to aid in use of common data formats (XML, JSON, CSV)

For more information, please see the [beginners guide](https://github.com/MentalAtom/Data.js/wiki)
It's simple, honest!

Current version: [0.1.0](https://github.com/MentalAtom/Data.js/releases/tag/0.1.0) - *unstable*

*Current to-do:*
* ~~Add a matcher for values which match a regex~~ - **Docs TODO**
* ~~Allow the use of wildcards in match expressions~~ - **WONTFIX** Matching a regex is a much better solution.
* ~~Test (and maybe fix) support for IE7 depending on how horrific it is~~ **FIXED** IE7 Support is so-far complete. Requires json2.js though. See the build folder for 0.2.0
* Add matchers for status (such as "is set" and "is empty")
* CSV sortBy function to sort by columns - **NEXT**

*Long term to-do:*
* XML Module:
* XML -> JXON and vice versa conversion
* CSV -> JXON -> XML (or direct CSV -> XML Wizardry)
* Open to suggestions + probably a few more things I've forgotten to put on this list :)
